## CISSP Study Approach  

1. Watch youtube videos and make notes, see playlist later in section below.  
2. Do the official study questions 4th edition and official study guide 10th edition questions.  
3. Use chatgpt latest version paid subscription as study buddy to upload documents, images and ask questions to provide detailed explanation of answers wrong and correct.  
4. Make memory mnemonics stories whiteboards drawings of each CISSP security domain, see mine below.  
5. Update notes more redoing questions and answers repeatedly.  
6. Repeat all above steps and rewatching the youtube videos again, and yes update study notes more.  

***Note:*** 
>My work exployment experience as a security engineer, security analyst and penetration tester in cybersecurity did help,  
>also my years before security provided my foundation skills,  
>but studying for the 2024 CISSP I learned a tremendous volume of data that filled in knowledge gaps.

## CISSP Questions Key Phrases  

>CISSP questions often involve **distractors** and complexity to challenge the understanding of the nuances in security principles.  
>The key is to read questions carefully, focus on what is being asked, and consider all answer choices critically, 
>looking for the one that aligns most closely with the best practices or principles within the domain of the question.  

>When **analyzing** CISSP questions, several key phrases and techniques are used to create ambiguity and challenge the test-taker.  
>These elements are designed to test your critical thinking and ability to apply concepts rather than just recall information.  
>Here’s a list of key phrases and techniques:  

### 1. **"Best," "Most Correct," or "Most Comprehensive"**  
   - **Purpose:** Forces you to prioritize or evaluate multiple correct answers.
   - **Examples:** 
     - “Select the best answer.”
     - “Indicate the most correct answer.”
     - “Which of the following best describes...”
   - **Challenge:** Requires you to assess which option most fully or accurately represents the concept being tested.

### 2. **"Likely" or "Typically"**  
   - **Purpose:** Introduces an element of probability, making you consider what generally applies rather than what is always true.
   - **Examples:** 
     - “Which of the following is most likely to...”
     - “Typically used in...”
   - **Challenge:** These terms can make answers seem less definitive and require deeper understanding of typical use cases or behaviors.

### 3. **"Not," "Except," or "But"**  
   - **Purpose:** Tests your attention to detail by asking for exceptions.
   - **Examples:** 
     - “Which of the following is NOT likely to...”
     - “All of the following are true EXCEPT...”
     - “Which technology uses this standard BUT is not maintained by...”
   - **Challenge:** These questions often trip up those who skim and assume they’re looking for something that matches rather than something that doesn’t.

### 4. **"Primarily," "Mainly," or "Primary"**  
   - **Purpose:** Narrows focus to the most important aspect or main responsibility.
   - **Examples:** 
     - “What is the primary goal of...”
     - “Mainly responsible for...”
   - **Challenge:** These terms require you to identify the most central role or function, which may be nuanced.

### 5. **"Ensure," "Guarantee," or "Prevent"**  
   - **Purpose:** Tests your understanding of absolute outcomes in security controls.
   - **Examples:**
     - “What can be implemented to ensure...”
     - “Which control prevents...”
   - **Challenge:** You need to choose the option that provides the most definitive or strongest solution, often ruling out softer or less absolute answers.

### 6. **"Which," "What," or "Where"**  
   - **Purpose:** These basic interrogatives introduce a scenario that requires specific knowledge.
   - **Examples:**
     - “Which of the following...”
     - “What is most appropriate...”
   - **Challenge:** They often lead into complex scenarios where multiple factors must be considered, forcing you to synthesize knowledge.

### 7. **"Simultaneously" or "At the Same Time"**  
   - **Purpose:** Tests understanding of systems or processes that operate under concurrent conditions.
   - **Examples:**
     - “Simultaneously handles information...”
   - **Challenge:** Requires recognition of environments or technologies that support or enforce concurrent conditions.

### 8. **"Evaluates," "Assesses," or "Monitors"**  
   - **Purpose:** Focuses on processes rather than results, testing your knowledge of methodologies.
   - **Examples:**
     - “Which process evaluates the effectiveness...”
     - “What assesses the risk...”
   - **Challenge:** You must distinguish between different methods or processes that have similar goals but are applied differently.

### 9. **"Match" or "Align"**  
   - **Purpose:** Tests your understanding of aligning strategies with specific systems or business needs.
   - **Examples:**
     - “Which activity best matches this task?”
     - “What best aligns with the business goals?”
   - **Challenge:** Requires synthesis of information about both strategic goals and specific systems or controls.

### 10. **Scenarios Describing Ambiguous Situations**  
   - **Purpose:** Presents a scenario where several answers may seem plausible, requiring deep analysis to identify the most correct answer.
   - **Examples:** 
     - “James is working with a system...”
     - “Ron is investigating a security incident...”
   - **Challenge:** The scenario is often complex, with subtle clues leading to the best answer. This tests both knowledge and application.

### 11. **"Is Responsible for," "Should Ensure," or "Is Required To"**  
   - **Purpose:** Focuses on roles and responsibilities within security frameworks.
   - **Examples:**
     - “Which role is primarily responsible for...”
     - “Who should ensure that...”
   - **Challenge:** Requires knowledge of specific roles (e.g., security administrator vs. system administrator) and their distinct responsibilities.

### 12. **Words Suggesting Partial Truths (e.g., "May," "Can," "Might")**  
   - **Purpose:** Introduces answers that are technically correct but not comprehensive.
   - **Examples:**
     - “This process may result in...”
   - **Challenge:** These options might be tempting because they’re correct, but they’re not the best or most complete answers.

### 13. **"Provides Insight Into"**  
   - **Purpose:** Tests your ability to differentiate between direct control effects and broader monitoring or insight functions.
   - **Examples:**
     - “Which provides insight into risk tolerance?”
   - **Challenge:** Forces you to think about indirect vs. direct impacts of controls or assessments.

## AI / LLM / ChatGPT  

>During my CISSP studies I used paid for subscription of ChatGPT to play the role of my study partner.
>I provided the following type of prompts to the model to aid in my studies and test my knowledge and skills:

```text
Assume the role of CISSP study partner that asks me questions, based on the updated study notes attached provided.
Ask me questions in the form of multiple choice, with the options all answer options very similar, almost all correct.
Make the questions in the form that a manager in the security department will select the one from the multiple answers,
that are more correct then the other choices.
Ask me one question and give the multiple choices answers, but do not move to the next question until I provide an answer.
If I answer incorrectly then, give me an explanation of the valid answer when I answer incorrectly.
Then only pose a new question after my answer provided from the same CISSP domain until I get 3 correct,
from one of the 8 domains based on the CISSP domain sections.
Use the follow list of words in building the questions,
to make it more difficult to determine the most correct answers from choices:

Goal
Primary goal
endpoint
Most
Mostly
Most important
Most appropriate
Most critical
Most effective
Unlikely
Incorrect
Not typically
not commonly
not normally
Not one
not true
not an essential process
not an effective
not a consideration
not a common step
Least 
LEAST likely
is least likely
avoid 
advantage 
shouldn’t
```
